welcome to pseudocode
my name is yogita sharma i am a software
engineer and you can get to know more
about me from the links down below
this is the first video in the series of
system design primer course
today i'm going to talk about the course
overview who is this course meant for
what you can learn from this course what
do you need to know in advance in order
to
study in this course and then we are
going to talk about what is system
what is design and why system design is
needed so let's get started
let's talk about the course overview if
you're looking for understanding the
basic building blocks of system design
doesn't matter if you're a computer
science major or you are looking
for changing jobs or you're already
working in the industry if you're
looking for
entry to system design the fundamentals
of system design this course is for you
the course is designed in a way where i
will explain all the topics in details
with real life examples
in the videos followed by quizzes and
exercises at the end of every video
and then discussing these topics in
detail via slack or through the comments
at the end of this course you will be
able to understand the process of system
design in a better way the fundamental
concepts
and you can go on to learn and build
large scale systems let's talk about
what is the system a system is a loosely
used term for an architecture or
collection of software or technology
that communicate with each other
interact with each other in order to
serve a certain set of users with a
certain set of requirements for example
image sharing system like instagram or
texting like whatsapp or
streaming systems like netflix or
hotstar etc
in real life also there are systems like
buildings
hotels hospitals theaters those are also
examples of large scale systems which
serve to the needs
of certain set of users with a certain
set of requirements all the systems beat
real-world systems or beat computing
systems
have certain things in common like they
are all built up of some
components or modules which need to
interact with each other and work
together
in order to fulfill the purpose of the
system for example in buildings all the
buildings have
walls floors ceilings electrical supply
water supply etc but different buildings
serve different users with different set
of requirements similarly in software
systems
even though basic building components
are same but they serve
different kind of users with different
set of requirements so a system can be
defined and built keeping these three
factors in mind
the user of the systems the requirements
of those users
and the components that are chosen in
order to build that system to serve
those users and their requirements now
that we understand
what a system is built off now let's
understand what is design design is a
process
of understanding the user requirements
and selecting the components
modules and software technologies how
they are going to be intertwined and
communicating with each other
to actually serve the need of the system
that is the basic definition of design
and that whole process of selecting
those components understanding the needs
of the user and the requirements
and also factoring in different
constraints and concerns
that whole process entails design even
though
the components of systems can be same or
the basic building blocks are same
the design for two different systems
looks very different
let's say design of a duplex is going to
look very different from design of a
skyscraper
similarly design of a website that
serves a static content or just like one
or two videos
is going to be very different from a
streaming platform like netflix in order
to understand
and develop this skill of designing
certain kind of systems which serve to
larger scale and larger users
the process of system design comes into
the picture now let's talk about
why system design is needed as a skill
or why system design is such a popular
topic the whole process is actually very
complicated it needs a lot of
experience expertise and knowledge about
software
technologies etc in order to build
successful large scale systems in real
world actually this is not done by one
person
but as an engineer one should know about
the components the trade-offs
the problems that have to be solved the
concerns of where systems can fail
how to handle those failures what are
the concerns and the constraints that
have to be addressed and taken care
of while designing a system so what we
are going to do here in this course is
we are going to pull apart the
components of a system
understand each component in separation
with pros and cons and why it is used
where it is used what are the advantages
and disadvantages
and then combine them together at the
end to build a large scale system this
is how this course is going to proceed
so that was a short introduction to
system design and why system design is
needed let me know in comments what you
liked about the video what you think
about the process of system design and
also there is a quiz for you
and some readings so that you can
understand this topic in a better way in
the next video i am going to talk about
components of system design till then
take care see you in the next video
